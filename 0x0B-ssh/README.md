Along with this project, you have been attributed an Ubuntu server, living in a datacenter far far away. Like level 2 of the application process, you will connect using ssh. But contrary to level 2, you will not connect using a `password` but an `RSA` key. Weâ€™ve configured your server with the public key you created in the first task of a previous project shared in your intranet profile.

You can access your server information in the my servers section of the intranet, each line with contains the `IP` and `username` you should use to connect via `ssh`.

**Note**: Your server is configured with an `Ubuntu 20.04 LTS` environment.
